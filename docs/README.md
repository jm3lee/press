# Documentation

Press's documentation is organized into three complementary collections
that cover day‑to‑day workflows and deeper technical background.

- [**guides/**](guides/README.md) – step‑by‑step instructions and
  workflow notes. Start here when you want to accomplish a task.
- [**reference/**](reference/README.md) – background material and format
  specifications that support and expand on the guides.
- [**pie/check/**](pie/check/README.md) – documentation for Pie's
  validation checkers.

Each section links to the other so you can easily switch between practical
how‑to articles and the detailed reference material they rely on.
