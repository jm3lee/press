## Analytics instrumentation hub

Press collects all engagement-analytics guidance in this section. Use these
notes to configure local TimescaleDB containers, run the React playground, and
roll out production-friendly ingestion pipelines.

### Quick links

  and its TimescaleDB dependency.
- [Engagement analytics demo](./demo.md) — launch the local playground that
  streams events into the live console.
- [User engagement tracking](./user-engagement-tracking.md) — adapt the
  instrumentation for private networking and long-term retention.

### Related examples
