#
# Description:
#   Remove the specified build directories and then invoke
#   `docker-make` with the same arguments. This is useful when
#   you want to force a clean rebuild of one or more targets.
#
# Usage:
#   docker-remake [TARGETS...]
#
# Example:
#   docker-remake build webp
#
# Each argument is recursively deleted with `rm -rf` before
# delegating to `docker-make` so the build artifacts are
# regenerated from scratch.

bin=$(dirname "$0")
rm -rf "$@"
$bin/docker-make "$@"
