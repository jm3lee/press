#!/bin/bash
#
# Description:
#   Invoke `make` inside the Docker Compose `shell` service.
#   This mirrors running `make -f app/shell/mk/build.mk` but
#   executes inside the container so the build environment is
#   consistent across systems. All arguments are passed directly
#   to the underlying `make` command.
#
# Usage:
#   docker-make [MAKE_TARGETS]
#
# Example:
#   docker-make all
#
# Run "make" in the container with the current user's UID so that
# generated files are owned by the invoking user. The container is
# removed after completion.

MAKE_CMD="docker compose run \
  --rm --entrypoint make -u $(id -u) \
  shell"

$MAKE_CMD -f /app/mk/build.mk "$@"
