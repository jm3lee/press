#
# Description:
#   Remove the specified build directories and then invoke
#   `make` inside the Docker Compose `shell` service. Runs
#   from the project root (/data) so the default `makefile`
#   is used, allowing a clean rebuild of one or more
#   targets.
#
# Usage:
#   remake [TARGETS...]
#
# Example:
#   remake build webp
#
# Each argument is recursively deleted with `rm -rf` before
# delegating to `make` so the build artifacts are
# regenerated from scratch. `make` is run via:
#   docker compose run --rm --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" shell make

rm -rf "$@"
docker compose run --rm --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" shell make "$@"
